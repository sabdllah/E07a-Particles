# E07a-Particles
Playing with particles and emitters
The parameters set the effect of the partciles. By playing with parameters scale, velocity and other factors, I am able to change the effect of the particle on the screen. I changed the sprites to see how the parameters affect different partciles. While they look the same, some particles pair well with a different effect. For example, fire pairs better with a higher velcity to illustrate the speed of fire.
